# Macroeconomics Projects

This repository contains selected reports developed for Intermediate Macroeconomics at BYU–Idaho. Each report applies key macroeconomic models to real-world scenarios using data, simulations, and theory-driven analysis. The goal of this collection is to demonstrate applied understanding of macroeconomic frameworks and policy implications.

## Featured Reports

These are four of my strongest macroeconomic reports, each applying core models to practical questions and/or real data:

- **[Solow Growth Model](reports/solow_model.pdf)**  
  Explores capital accumulation, convergence, and the steady state using the Solow framework. Includes simulations of savings and population growth effects on output over time.

- **[Empirical Estimation of the IS Curve](reports/Should_Do_Ch_11_Empirical_Estimation_of_the_IS_Curve.pdf)**  
  Uses FRED data to estimate the sensitivity of investment to interest rates. Demonstrates regression analysis and empirical testing of theoretical parameters.

- **[IS-MP Simulations and Policy Analysis](reports/Should_Do_Ch_12_IS_MP_Simulations_Report.pdf)**  
  Runs simulations of shocks (COVID-19, housing bubbles, productivity shifts) within the IS-MP model. Recommends monetary policy responses based on real-world logic and model calibration.

- **[Growth Accounting and Cross-Country Comparison](reports/Should_Do_Ch_4_Growth_Accounting_Report.pdf)**  
  Analyzes GDP differences across countries using Cobb-Douglas and Hall-Jones models. Includes discussion on human capital, TFP, and misallocation. Accompanied by Excel-based data analysis.

## Tools Used

- **Overleaf (LaTeX)** — for professional document formatting and typesetting  
- **Quarto (.qmd)** — for rendering reports and integrating code/math  
- **Microsoft Excel** — for data cleaning and model inputs (used in the Growth Accounting report)  
- **FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)** — for real-world macroeconomic data

## Future Plans

This repository currently includes report PDFs only. Future updates will include code notebooks (Python, R, or Quarto) and datasets used in simulations and regressions to make the analysis fully reproducible.
