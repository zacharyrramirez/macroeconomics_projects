## ðŸ“„ Featured Reports

These are four of my strongest macroeconomic reports, each applying key models to real-world data or simulations using frameworks taught in Intermediate Macroeconomics:

- **[Solow Growth Model](reports/solow_model.pdf)**  
  Explores capital accumulation, convergence, and the steady state using the Solow framework. Includes simulations of savings and population growth effects on output over time.

- **[Empirical Estimation of the IS Curve](reports/Should_Do_Ch_11_Empirical_Estimation_of_the_IS_Curve.pdf)**  
  Uses FRED data to estimate the sensitivity of investment to interest rates. Demonstrates regression analysis and empirical testing of theoretical parameters.

- **[IS-MP Simulations and Policy Analysis](reports/Should_Do_Ch_12_IS_MP_Simulations_Report.pdf)**  
  Runs simulations of shocks (COVID-19, housing bubbles, productivity shifts) within the IS-MP model. Recommends monetary policy responses based on real-world logic and model calibration.

- **[Growth Accounting and Cross-Country Comparison](reports/Should_Do_Ch_4_Growth_Accounting_Report.pdf)**  
  Analyzes GDP differences across countries using Cobb-Douglas and Hall-Jones models. Includes discussion on human capital, TFP, and misallocation. Accompanied by Excel-based data analysis.
